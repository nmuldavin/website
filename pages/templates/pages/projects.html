            <h2>Undergraduate Thesis</h2>
            <p>I wrote an undergraduate thesis on
                <em>The N-Body Simulation of Galaxy Dynamics.</em>
                To produce the main result I wrote an N-Body simulation code to model the evolution of an SC class galaxy.
                A video of the final run is included below.
                I put a lot of effort in to the document itself, including extensive historical discussion
                and scientific background leading up to a discussion of the result.
                You can view the document  <a href="{% url 'pages:thesis' %}">here</a>.

            <h2>N-Body Simulation Package</h2>
            <p>
                As the culmination of my undergraduate research I wrote a polished astrophysical N-Body simulation code in C++ designed to be used by
                future students interested either in using the code or writing another. It includes an adaptive timestep routine,
                a tree-code force calculation routine, and routines to aid in the construction of initial conditions to model a composite disk galaxy.
                In addition, it includes extensive code documentation and guides to using the code and understanding
                the nuances of astrophysical N-Body simulation. The full package is hosted <a href="https://github.com/nmuldavin/NBodyIntegrator">on my GitHub</a>.
                A section of the code is included below.

            <h2>This Website</h2>
            <p>
                I made this website! It is mostly static HTML/CSS but uses some Django functionality
                for template inheritance and a few other things (notice it highlighting the current page you're on).
            </p>

            <h2>Physics Lab Curriculum and Technical Writing</h2>
            <p>
                I have an extensive portfolio of lab curriculum I wrote during my time as the lab coordinator at Reed College.
                It would not be appropriate to post on a public site, please contact me if you are interested in sample work.
            </p>

            <h2>In Progress: A Django App for Cocktail Enthusiasts</h2>

                I am currently working on an app designed for cocktail enthusiasts to organize recipes and make notes about their
                favorite drinks, brands, and tips.
